# Add custom music discs to Minecraft using only a datapack and a resource pack!

Included are two sample packs, which you can rename and use for your world/server. The resourcepack is for the client, the datapack goes into the datapacks folder of your world. All instructions are in the `add_disc.sh` file.

Usage: ```./add_disc.sh <name of the data+resource pack> <Display name of the song - Author> <filename of the song> <length in seconds>```
So, for example ```./add_disc.sh "Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley" rickroll 212```

Made on Linux, for Linux, if you are on Windows, just get something that runs bash scripts, I'm not touching that with a 3.048m pole (yes, we use metric here).
